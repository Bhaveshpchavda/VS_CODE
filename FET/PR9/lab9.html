      JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
      Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage

    <div class="menu-content" id="menu-content-3">
      The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML
      document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM
      represents a document with a logical tree.

    <div class="menu-content" id="menu-content-4">
      Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is a term which was used by some browser vendors to describe the combination of HTML,
      style sheets and client-side scripts that enabled the creation of interactive and animated documents. The
      application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997.
