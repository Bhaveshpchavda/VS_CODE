    <h3 id="head-1">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the
      standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
      assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting
      languages such as
      JavaScript.</h3>
    <h3 id="head-2">Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language
      used for describing the presentation
      of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or
      XML. CSS is a
      cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
      and JavaScript.</h3>
    <h3 id="head-3">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a
      programming language that is one of the core
      technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As
      of 2022, 98% of
      websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
      behavior, often incorporating
      third-party libraries.</h3>
    <h3 id="head-4">The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and
      language-independent interface
      that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure
      wherein each node is an
      object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents
      a document with a
      logical tree.</h3>
    <h3 id="head-5">Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is a term which was used
      by some browser vendors to
      describe the combination of HTML, style sheets and client-side
      scripts that enabled the
      creation of interactive and animated documents. The
      application of DHTML was
      introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer
      4 in 1997.</h3>
